# Create a simple invitation

This guide covers the minimum flow to get a first invite out the door.

## Step 1: Create the invitation

1. Open the dashboard and choose New invitation.
2. Minimally add a title, event date, and time.
3. Save the invitation so you can attach a template next.

## Step 2: Add location details

Add a location name and address. If you include a map link or embed code, the
template will inject it into the element with id `map_link`.

## Step 3: Add notes sections

Use Notes, Notes section 2, and Notes section 3 for extra details. Each one
maps to its own placeholder id: `notes`, `notes_2`, `notes_3`.

## Step 4: Preview

Add a live or draft URL, save, then use the matching preview button.

- **Preview live** uses your live template URL.
- **Preview draft** uses your draft template URL.

The draft URL is useful for rapid template iteration, including local templates.
If you serve templates locally, enable CORS in your local server.

Example with `http-serve`:

```bash
npx http-serve --cors
```

That serves `index.html` at `http://localhost:8080` (or `http://localhost:8080/<file>.html` for named files).
