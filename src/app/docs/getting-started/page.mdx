# Create a simple invitation

This guide covers the minimum flow to get a first invite out the door.

## Step 1: Create the invitation

1. Open the dashboard and choose New invitation.
2. Add a title, event date, and time.
3. Save the invitation so you can attach a template next.

## Step 2: Add location details

Add a location name and address. If you include a map link or embed code, the
template will inject it into the element with id `map_link`.

## Step 3: Add notes sections

Use Notes, Notes section 2, and Notes section 3 for extra details. Each one
maps to its own placeholder id: `notes`, `notes_2`, `notes_3`.

## Step 4: Preview

Provide a draft template URL and open the preview. If the template is missing a
placeholder element, that value is simply skipped.
