# Manage guests

Guests are organized into groups so you can track invitations and RSVPs at the
household level.

## Add guest groups

1. Open your invitation in the dashboard.
2. Choose Manage guests.
3. Add a group name, expected adults, and expected kids.

## How guest links work

Each group gets a unique link. When guests open it, the template receives their
name and expected counts. These values map to `guest_name`, `expected_adults`,
`expected_kids`, and `expected_total`.

## When to update counts

Update expected counts when you learn about additional guests. The RSVP form
still lets guests confirm or revise their total before submitting.
