# Manage guests

Guests are organized into groups so you can track invitations and RSVPs at the
household level.

## Add guest groups

1. Open your invitation in the dashboard.
2. Choose Manage guests.
3. Add a group name, expected adults, and expected kids.
4. Optional: add a guest-specific note (placeholder id `guest_message`).

Guest-specific notes are useful for per-group instructions, such as `+1`
details, arrival notes, or household-specific context.

## How guest links work

Each group gets a unique link. When guests open it, the template receives group
data through placeholders like `guest_name`, `guest_message`,
`expected_adults`, `expected_kids`, and `expected_total`.

`Allow open count` controls how strictly counts are enforced:

- **On**: guests can enter any non-negative count.
- **Off**: guests can enter counts up to the host-defined limits.

## Open links

Open links let you send one RSVP URL to many people. Guests self-identify by
name when submitting.

When someone responds from an open link, a guest group is created in guest
management. Returning from the same browser/device usually reconnects them to
their previous response. If they later sign in or create an account, they can
manage linked responses from `My RSVPs`.
