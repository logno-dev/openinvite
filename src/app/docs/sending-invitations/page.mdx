# Send invitations

OpenInvite supports two distribution patterns: guest-specific links and a
public RSVP link.

## Guest-specific links

Use guest group links when you already know the invitees. Each link injects the
guest name and counts into the template, and the RSVP form submits the group
token automatically.

## Open RSVP link

Use the open link when you want guests to self-identify. The form will ask for
name and counts before submitting.

## Share tips

- Include the calendar link if you want guests to save the date.
- Confirm your live template URL before sending public links.
