# RSVP options

RSVP labels and counting rules live on the invitation edit screen.

## Response labels

You can edit the text for Yes, No, and Maybe. These labels are injected into
the template at `rsvp_yes_label`, `rsvp_no_label`, and `rsvp_maybe_label`.

## Count modes

- **Split** tracks adults and kids separately.
- **Total** captures a single guest count for each response.

Choose the mode that matches how you plan to track attendance. The RSVP form
adapts automatically.
