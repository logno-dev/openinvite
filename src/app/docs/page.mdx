# OpenInvite docs

OpenInvite lets you bring your own HTML invite, manage guests, and collect RSVPs
without giving up your design. This section walks through the full workflow and
the templating rules that keep your pages safe and consistent.

## Start here

- [Create a simple invitation](/docs/getting-started)
- [Manage guests](/docs/managing-guests)
- [RSVP options](/docs/rsvp-options)
- [Send invitations](/docs/sending-invitations)
- [Template system](/docs/templating)

## What OpenInvite injects

Every template is sanitized, then data is injected by element id. If a value is
missing, the element is removed. This makes it easy to build layouts that adapt
to optional details like maps and extra notes.

> Use the template page to see all placeholder IDs and HTML rules.
